                            <h5>To ensure access to our services and improve their delivery</h5>
                            <p>We use your data, even without your express consent (Art. 6 letters b) - e) of GDPR), to ensure access to our services and for the following service purposes:  </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For sales purposes, thus for purposes strictly related and instrumental to the establishment, management, and execution of contractual relationships by the Controller; </li>
                                <li>For preliminary activities (such as drafting quotes and identifying the "target market") or instrumental to the above (such as registering, organizing, and storing data collected for the treatments in question);  </li>
                                <li>For the exercise and defense of the Controller's rights and for purposes arising from regulatory obligations, to which the Controller is bound by law or regulation (e.g., anti-fraud activities, insurance supervision on claims, etc.); </li>
                                <li>For communication to other subjects in the distribution chain and for processing and transfer abroad, including outside the EU, exclusively for the above purposes and for purposes arising from legal obligations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These processes are necessary to correctly deliver the services of ConvieneOnline, AssicurazioniRc.it, and AssicurazioniMutuo.com to users who adhere to them.</p>
                            <h5>To inform you about our commercial activities</h5>
                            <p>In particular, we use the data for marketing purposes (via activities carried out through personal interviews, questionnaires, postal mail, phone—including mobile—via operator, or through automated calling systems, email, fax, MMS or SMS messages, or other types) aimed at improving or promoting the Controller's products/services, such as: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sending advertising material;  </li>
                                <li>Direct sales;</li>
                                <li>Conducting market research;</li>
                                <li>Commercial communication.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>To offer you a personalized service </h5>
                            <p>We process the collected data, if you have expressly given us consent, to analyze your habits or consumption choices to offer you an increasingly personalized service aligned with your interests and to improve our commercial offerings. These analyses are not in any case linked to an automated decision-making process.  <br>
                                In particular, we use them for the Controller's profiling purposes to prepare and send personalized marketing offers and communications through activities carried out via personal interviews, questionnaires, postal mail, phone—including mobile—via operator, and automated calling systems, email, fax, MMS or SMS messages, or other means, even using other companies—usually designated as Processors—and other companies like Heca Unipersonale S.r.l., with which there are specific agreements to provide services, also designated as Processors. </p>
                            <h5>IS PROVIDING DATA MANDATORY?</h5>
                            <p>Providing personal data is mandatory only for processing necessary for the provision of services offered by Menev.it (any refusal for service provision purposes (see point 1.1) makes it impossible to use the service itself); it is optional for promotional purposes (see point 1.2) and profiling (see point 1.3), and any refusal to give consent does not negatively affect the provision of the service offered on the website www.menev.it and related applications.</p>
                            <h5>WHO ARE THE DATA PROCESSORS? </h5>
                            <p>The Data Controller is Heca Unipersonale S.r.l. of Masciangelo Giuseppina, with registered office at Via Roma, 42/B 66026 Ortona (CH) - VAT no. 02505870697.  <br>
                                The Controller uses processors to achieve the purposes specified in point 1 and a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee the protection of personal data. For any request regarding your personal data, please refer to point 3.2 below.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Data Protection Officer (DPO) and contact information  </h5>
